# Final Self-Assessment of Data Structures and Algorithms

Your last task is to write a **final self-assessment** of what you know after this course.

* **Note: Final Self-assessments can be written in English or in Finnish**. If you write it in Finnish, translate the self-assessment template into Finnish, but keep the numbering of the headings the same.

Do a final self-assessment of your skills and goals in the field of data structures and algorithms **after the course**.
Rename this Markdown document in your repository and name it in the format **LastnameFirstname-FinalSelfAssessment.md**.  

> The most important thing is to be honest with yourself and strive for an objective assessment of your own skills. 
  Self-reflection helps you better understand your strengths and weaknesses and can be used as a learning tool.

Consider the following points in your final self-assessment:

1. Discuss the data structures and algorithms you have used, learned or developed in this course. 
   Describe how you know how to design algorithms, measure the effectiveness of algorithms or the ability to apply different data structures and algorithms.

2. Give concrete examples of successes or challenges you have faced in learning data structures and algorithms.
   Describe how you know different data structures and algorithms and what kind of new programming experience you have after the course.

3. Identify the topics and areas of programming where you feel the need for additional practice or understanding after the course. 
   Think about and document what you learned about data structures and algorithms in this course.
   Consider and document your future learning and improvement goals related to data structures and algorithms.
   Summarize your programming journey by highlighting the skills you acquired, including a general understanding of programming, skills in various data structures and algorithms, hands-on experience, or implementing a project that utilizes data structures and algorithms.

## Self-Assessment Template 

In your answer, follow the following **Self-Assessment Template**.

## 1. Introduction

In this self-assessment I will reflect on what I have learned during this course. I will describe how my studies went and what kind of new exepriences I have after this course. Finally, I will reflect on what I achieved and what I wish to improve on and learn in the future. 

## 2. Skills

In this course, I learned to differentiate between different data structures, such as arrays, stack and queue. I also learned what design steps are take in creating algorithms and how to define algorithms. I also learned what affects algorithms' performace and how O(n) notation is used to evaluate the performance and complexity. 
I feel that I understand the basic concept of data structures and algorithms and I can identify different structures in other small-scale programs I've created in other classes and projects. Especially in the current Computational Algorithms course. 

## 3. Learning

I feel that I experienced a lot of challenges solving the exercises of this course. I think I need more practice to fully comprehend how to use and apply different data structures and algorithms. I am still a bit confused with how some things work, for example, linked lists. Some parts I feel I understand the theory better than how to actually implement it, like trees and graphs. It was great to dive deeper into arrays and learn different sorting types. I used that a lot in different Data Analystics and AI courses this semester as well. It was interesting to learn about how using different data structures impacts the performance and memeory and how important it is to know what to choose when designing an algorithm. 

## 4. Objectives

In my future, I want to practice more implementation of different data structures, especially trees and graphs, since those confuse me the most. I would also like to practice using different approaches and comparing the performance and memory usage to better learn what are best-case scenarios for different occassions. 

## 5. Conclusion

In my initial self-assessment, I wrote: "My primary goal is to confidently write my code and understand what I am writing, even if it's just the basics. I wish to have a solid foundation that I can continue to build upon. I would also like to understand the different data structures and how to use them, and in what scenarios."

I think that this objective was somewhat fullfilled since I feel more confident to try and fail writing code and creating algorithms. I also found more motivation to explore what and why my code would go wrong most of the time. I am not sugar-coating my work in this course, there was a lot of dead-ends and moments when I didn't know how to start or how to fix something, even with Internet on my side. I feel this process made me more confident, and the contents of the course made me better informed to make less mistakes or find answers to my errors better.
