# Self-Assessment of Data Structures and Algorithms

First write a self-assessment of what you know before this course.

* **Note: Self-assessments can be written in English or in Finnish**. If you write it in Finnish, translate the self-assessment template into Finnish, but keep the numbering of the headings the same. 

Do a self-assessment of your current skills and goals in the field of data structures and algorithms **at the beginning of the course**..
Rename this Markdown document in the repository and rename it as **YourLastnameYourFirstname-SelfAssessment.md**.

> The most important thing is to be honest with yourself and strive for an objective assessment of your own skills. 
Self-reflection helps you better understand your strengths and weaknesses and can be used as a learning tool.

Consider the following points in your self-assessment:

1. Discuss the data structures and algorithms you have used, learned or developed before the course. 
   Describe how you know how to design algorithms, measure the effectiveness of algorithms or the ability to apply different data structures and algorithms.

2. Describe the projects, courses, or assignments where you have previously worked with data structures or algorithms. 
   Describe how you know different algorithms and what kind of programming experience you have.

3. Identify the topics and areas of programming where you feel the need for additional practice or understanding. 
   Think about and document what you plan to learn and improve your skills about data structures and algorithms in this course.  
   This may include mastering a particular algorithm, understanding data structures, or implementing a software project that utilizes data structures and algorithms.

## 1. Introduction

In this self-assessment I will reflect on my own feelings regarding the contents of this course and what I expect to gain from it. 

## 2. Skills

I recognize that I lack more practice in Python programming language and I should build up my skills in other programming languages, such as C++.
I feel that I do well in writing scripts, since I felt confident enough to create some scripts for work which ended up being used by others as well. 
Nevertheless, I feel that I lack confidence in programming and have doubts about my understanding of the subject. 
Overall, I feel that I understand the basic concept of an algorithm and I can identify it in other small-scale programs I've created in other classes. 

## 3. Learning

Before this class, we had prgramming classes, such as Basics of Programming and Object-Oriented Programming. I found the latter a bit challenging, but overall, I feel that I learned a bit moreabout how to think logically and how to structure and organize functions and programs. 
Data structures were never really the primary topic in other classes, and were occassionally mentioned as something that exists. There was more focus on different data types and how to use them. However, I was aware that there is a difference compared to and array, for example. 

## 4. Objectives

My primary goal is to confidently write my code and understand what I am writing, even if it's just the basics. I wish to have a solid foundation that I can continue to build upon.
I would also like to understand the different data structures and how to use them, and in what scenarios.

## 5. Conclusion

Overall, I am starting this course a bit insecure and hesitant but I hope to reach at least these goals:
   - write better code
   - learn how to use different data structures
