LIST 

example_list = ["abc", 123, "some words", 1.23]

Lists can contain different data types. Items can be changed in a list (removed, added, replaced).

ARRAY 

import array
example_array = array.array('u', ["a", "2", "3"])

Arrays are great for large datasets. The items in the array can be changed.
However, an array can hold one type of data (only integers or only string, for example).
Arrays can be created, for example, from array module or numpy library.

TUPLE 

example_tuple = ("abc", 123, "some words", 1.23)

Tuples contain elements that cannot be modified. 
A tuple can be spliced or indexed to access its elements. But, its contents cannot be modified. 
Just like lists, tuples can also hold elements of different types.
Good use for when the data shouldn't change.

These data types all have pros and cons and their use depends on the use case. 
List are generally used to store data because they are easily changed and manipulate.
However, when working with large datasets, arrays are more efficient and work faster than lists. 
Tuples are great for fixed data that needs to be read or accessed in some way but not changed.
